Cron.php execution

======================

phpauction needs cron.php to run regularly to check expired auctions and

close them updating the database and sending e-mails to sellers and winners.



Under *nix this is simple since you can run the script using a cron job, for example once a day.

If you don't know what a cron job is go here for more information:

Under Windows things are not so simple. Marcello Scacchetti wrote a C utility you

can use to run cron periodically. It is in the "cron" directory in the distribution.

There's a README file which explains how to use it.



Please Note that if you plan on calling cron.php directly, it must be parsed by

a php capable web server, most likely via a web browser. Simply trying to

execute cron.php from a command line is generally only going to result in

failure.
