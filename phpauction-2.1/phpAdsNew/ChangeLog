                          <iframe>-tags.

                        + Added preliminary support for fail-safe banners.



v 0.9.3 - 03/10/1999    + Changed mt_rand() to rand() in kcms.php3 for better

                          downward-compatiblity.

                        + Changed the way the session data is retrieved from the

                          database for better compatibility with MySQL. 3.21.x.

                        + Bugfix: viewbanner.php3 had a stripslashes where it 

                          wasn't needed.

                        + Improved navigation.

                        + Some changes to the file layout.

                          specified by view(), a warning was displayed.

                        + Outsourced the view() function to a separate file

                          ("view.inc.php3") to avoid global namespace pollution.



v 0.9.2 - 03/06/1999    + Bugfix: The remote hostname wasn't showed correctly in

                          the daily statistics.

                          banner was in the inventory.

                        + Bugfix: The whole stuff didn't work with files outside

                          the phpAds-tree. Corrected.

                        + Added this ChangeLog.
