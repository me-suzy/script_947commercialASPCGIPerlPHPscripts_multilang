  a long time, but since version 1.9 phpAdsNew now supports compact statistics 
  and the compact stats are even used by default. Compact statistics are faster 
  than verbose stats and take a lot less storage space on the MySQL server. There 
  is a drawback however, the compact stats are less accurate than the old verbose 
  stats, there are no hourly overviews for example.</p><p><br><span class="subtitle">How can I speed up phpAdsNew?</span><br>You can speed up phpAdsNew considerably by reducing the functionality. You 
  could disable multiple keywords and conditional keywords. You could enable 'delayed 
  inserts' as well, which should increase the speed of statistics logging. Other 
  things that influence the speed of phpAdsNew are reverse lookup, sequential 
  banner retrieval and banners stored in MySQL. If you really need to serve massive 
  amounts of banners you could try using multiple servers. It is possible to store 
  banners on an external ftp/webserver, use a different server for the MySQL database 
  and serve the ads from a different server as your webserver. It is even possible 
  to use multiple servers which all have phpAdsNew and MySQL installed and use 
  same database which is replicated over all the servers.</p><p><br><span class="subtitle">My MySQL server uses too many resources, what can I do?</span><br>You can reduce the load on the MySQL server by storing banners on the webserver 
  instead of the MySQL server. It is also possible use 'delayed inserts' which 
  can be turned on in the configuration file. If phpAdsNew uses persistent connections 
  to the MySQL server you could try turning this off in the configuration file. 
  Persistent connections do speed up phpAdsNew, but increase the load on the MySQL 
  server. <br></p><p><br><span class="subtitle">Can you help me to install phpAdsNew? Can you please implement this feature

  being submitted in IE<br></span>This is a known bug in IE 4 and higher. phpAdsNew 1.9 does have a workaround 
  for this bug, but it only works in remote invocation with JavaScript and local 
  mode. Normal remote invocation is still affected by this bug. Microsoft is aware 
  of this bug for some time and IE 6 apparently works fine. If you use normal 
  remote invocation there is nothing we can do about it.</p><p><br><span class="subtitle">phpAdsNew doesn't display any HTML banners</span><br>HTML banners are only supported if you use remote invocation with JavaScript 
  of local mode. It is not possible to display HTML banner with normal remote 
  invocation.</p><p><span class="subtitle"><br>The login doesn't work, it keeps prompting for username/password all over

  Make sure $phpAds_url_prefix in config.inc.php is exactly the same as it is 
  on the server (http://www.test.com/phpads is not the same as http://www.test.com/phpAds). 
  Also make sure it doesn't end with a slash (/).</p><p><br><span class="subtitle">I get the following error: Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function

  recompile PHP --with-mysql. If you're on Windows, you have to enable the MySQL 
  DLL in your PHP configuration. See the manual, installation section, for more 
  details.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td class="plain">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td width="100" height="75">&nbsp;</td><td width="600" height="75">&nbsp;</td><td height="75">&nbsp;</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
