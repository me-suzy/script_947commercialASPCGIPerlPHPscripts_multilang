Some words about the categories/subcategories structure.

Phpauction comes with a default and general categories

tree but, of course, you can personalize it as you need.



You have to ways to do that:

1. (SLOWER)

	Access the admin control panel and use the categories management 

	option to add/change/delete categories.

	This is ok if you don't have to make many changes to the original

	structure.

	

2. (FASTER)

	create a text file and call it categories.txt.

	The structure of this file must be like the following:

	- all categories at the top most level must be entered like

	

		1@Art & Antiques

		1@Animals

	

	- all second level categories must be entered like

	

		2@Amateur Art

	  below the corresponding "father" and before the next

	  1@ category.

	  The sample above would be:

	  



		1@Art & Antiques

		2@Amateur Art

		1@Animals

		

	  This means Amateur Art is a subcategory of Art & Antiques.

	  

	- If a 2@ category has "children" they must be entered like:

	

		3@Paintings

		3@Sculpture

		

	  Below the 2@ corresponding "father" and before other 2@ categories.

	  The sample above would become:



		1@Art & Antiques

		2@Amateur Art

		1@Animals

		3@Paintings

		3@Sculpture

		

	Once you have created your categories.txt file, place it in the includes directory.

	The includes directory contains a sample categories file corresponding

	to the default categories tree: save it somewhere if you want.

	

	Point your browser to:

	

		http://www.yourdomain.com/phpauction/includes/populate_categories.php

		

	and after this



		http://www.yourdomain.com/phpauction/admin/util_cc1.php

		http://www.yourdomain.com/phpauction/admin/util_cc2.php

		

	Please note that the above scripts will not produce any output to your browser.

	If all works fine, util_cc1.php calls util_cc2.php so there's no need to call

	util_cc2.php.
