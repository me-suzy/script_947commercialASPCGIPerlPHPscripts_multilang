Auction Update - command line tool to handle cron jobs 
======================================================

Auction Update is an Open Source Tool intended into c language to be used under 
Windows (95/98/ME/NT/2000) to handle the problem of updating auctions checking ending
time and eventually removing them from the auctions database and send emails to
sellers and bidders.
This little tool was mainly developed under Debian 2.2 Linux and using Cygnus compiler
(formely called cygwin) ported under windows as an exutable file. For more info on
Cygnus compiler please refer to: http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/ .
To compile this tool follow this simple step:
./build.sh
build.sh is a bash script to run the compiler.
Now you have two compiled files:
auctionupdate
and
auctionupdate.exe
Of course under windows environment you should used the second one.
auctionupdate accept two paramter on command line: hostname and uri. Talking simple
words you can run auctionupdate in this way:
./auctionupdate yourhostname /path/to/cron.php
Under windows environment you can run this tool at determined intervals using
a batch file and windows native scheduler.
I've put a sample batch file called run.bat, of course you have to modify it
to suite your needs.
