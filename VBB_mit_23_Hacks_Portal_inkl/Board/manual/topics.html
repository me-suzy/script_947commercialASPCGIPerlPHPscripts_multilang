With Topics Manager you can add, delete or modify your Topics.<br><br>

Each Topic will have a text identifier, description text and
graphic.<br><br>

To add a new topic just fill the form in this page.<br><br>

<b>Topic Name:</b> This is the identifier. Is used for some
internal processes. Write a name in lowercase without
spaces. If you want the identifier to a topic called <i>Me and You</i>,
for example, just write <i>meandyou</i> or something like that.<br><br>

<b>Topic Text:</b> This is the text that will appear to the user and
in the Alternative Text (Alt) for each topic graphic. You can use up
and lowercase and spaces as well.<br><br>

<b>Topic Image:</b> The image filename, not the complete path, just the
filename and the extension, for example: <i>entertainment.gif</i> The
system will look for the image under <i>images</i> directory in your
system.<br><br>

To edit an existing topic, just click on the image of the topic you
want to edit. After clicking the image you will see a new page where
you can change the Topic Name, Text and Image or just delete the current
topic. <br><br>
