<br><br>

FAQs are a good source of information for your visitors, and a godsend for you! Using very well written FAQs that cover most common questions your vistors have will keep you from getting literally hundreds of support emails! Make <i>very</i> good use of this section!<br><br>

First you will need to add you <b>Categories</b>. These can be whatever you like, but usually reflect a certain product or section on your site. Simply type in a category name and click the <i>Save</i> button.<br><br>

Once you have some categories, you may either <b>Edit</b> or <b>Delete</b> them by clicking on the respective links to the right of each category.<br><br>

There is one more item you will notice, and that is <b>Content</b>. This is the "meat" of your FAQ and where you will post your questions and the answers to go along with them.<br><br>

Once you are in the <b>Content</b> area of your FAQ, you will see a list of each question (and its answer). There are links on the right side of each question that allows you to <b>Edit</b> or <b>Delete</b> the questions. To add a new question, you just fill out the form and click on the <i>Save</i> button.<br><br>
